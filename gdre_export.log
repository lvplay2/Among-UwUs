The following files were converted from an import that was stored lossy.
You may lose fidelity when re-importing these files upon loading the project.

Use Godot editor version 3.2.3 to edit the project.
Note: the project may be using a custom version of Godot. Detection for this has not been implemented yet.
If you find that you have many non-import errors upon opening the project 
(i.e. scripts or shaders have many errors), use the original game's binary as the export template.
